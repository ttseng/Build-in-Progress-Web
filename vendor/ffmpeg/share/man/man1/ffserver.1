.SH "NAME"
ffserver \- ffserver video server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ffserver [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBffserver\fR is a streaming server for both audio and video. It
supports several live feeds, streaming from files and time shifting on
live feeds (you can seek to positions in the past on each live feed,
provided you specify a big enough feed storage in
\&\fIffserver.conf\fR).
.PP
\&\fBffserver\fR receives prerecorded files or \s-1FFM\s0 streams from some
\&\fBffmpeg\fR instance as input, then streams them over
\&\s-1RTP/RTSP/HTTP\s0.
.PP
An \fBffserver\fR instance will listen on some port as specified
in the configuration file. You can launch one or more instances of
\&\fBffmpeg\fR and send one or more \s-1FFM\s0 streams to the port where
ffserver is expecting to receive them. Alternately, you can make
\&\fBffserver\fR launch such \fBffmpeg\fR instances at startup.
.PP
Input streams are called feeds, and each one is specified by a
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Feed>\*(C'\fR section in the configuration file.
.PP
For each feed you can have different output streams in various
formats, each one specified by a \f(CW\*(C`<Stream>\*(C'\fR section in the
configuration file.
.SS "Status stream"
.IX Subsection "Status stream"
ffserver supports an \s-1HTTP\s0 interface which exposes the current status
of the server.
.PP
Simply point your browser to the address of the special status stream
specified in the configuration file.
.PP
For example if you have:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        <Stream status.html>
\&        Format status
\&        
\&        # Only allow local people to get the status
\&        ACL allow localhost
\&        ACL allow 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
\&        </Stream>
.Ve
.PP
then the server will post a page with the status information when
the special stream \fIstatus.html\fR is requested.
.SS "What can this do?"
.IX Subsection "What can this do?"
When properly configured and running, you can capture video and audio in real
time from a suitable capture card, and stream it out over the Internet to
either Windows Media Player or RealAudio player (with some restrictions).
.PP
It can also stream from files, though that is currently broken. Very often, a
web server can be used to serve up the files just as well.
.PP
It can stream prerecorded video from .ffm files, though it is somewhat tricky
to make it work correctly.
.SS "How do I make it work?"
.IX Subsection "How do I make it work?"
First, build the kit. It *really* helps to have installed \s-1LAME\s0 first. Then when
you run the ffserver ./configure, make sure that you have the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libmp3lame\*(C'\fR flag turned on.
.PP
\&\s-1LAME\s0 is important as it allows for streaming audio to Windows Media Player.
Don't ask why the other audio types do not work.
.PP
As a simple test, just run the following two command lines where \s-1INPUTFILE\s0
is some file which you can decode with ffmpeg:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        ffserver \-f doc/ffserver.conf &
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUTFILE http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm
.Ve
.PP
At this point you should be able to go to your Windows machine and fire up
Windows Media Player (\s-1WMP\s0). Go to Open \s-1URL\s0 and enter
.PP
.Vb 1
\&            http://<linuxbox>:8090/test.asf
.Ve
.PP
You should (after a short delay) see video and hear audio.
.PP
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 trying to stream test1.mpg doesn't work with \s-1WMP\s0 as it tries to
transfer the entire file before starting to play.
The same is true of \s-1AVI\s0 files.
.SS "What happens next?"
.IX Subsection "What happens next?"
You should edit the ffserver.conf file to suit your needs (in terms of
frame rates etc). Then install ffserver and ffmpeg, write a script to start
them up, and off you go.
.SS "Troubleshooting"
.IX Subsection "Troubleshooting"
\fII don't hear any audio, but video is fine.\fR
.IX Subsection "I don't hear any audio, but video is fine."
.PP
Maybe you didn't install \s-1LAME\s0, or got your ./configure statement wrong. Check
the ffmpeg output to see if a line referring to \s-1MP3\s0 is present. If not, then
your configuration was incorrect. If it is, then maybe your wiring is not
set up correctly. Maybe the sound card is not getting data from the right
input source. Maybe you have a really awful audio interface (like I do)
that only captures in stereo and also requires that one channel be flipped.
If you are one of these people, then export 'AUDIO_FLIP_LEFT=1' before
starting ffmpeg.
.PP
\fIThe audio and video lose sync after a while.\fR
.IX Subsection "The audio and video lose sync after a while."
.PP
Yes, they do.
.PP
\fIAfter a long while, the video update rate goes way down in \s-1WMP\s0.\fR
.IX Subsection "After a long while, the video update rate goes way down in WMP."
.PP
Yes, it does. Who knows why?
.PP
\fI\s-1WMP\s0 6.4 behaves differently to \s-1WMP\s0 7.\fR
.IX Subsection "WMP 6.4 behaves differently to WMP 7."
.PP
Yes, it does. Any thoughts on this would be gratefully received. These
differences extend to embedding \s-1WMP\s0 into a web page. [There are two
object IDs that you can use: The old one, which does not play well, and
the new one, which does (both tested on the same system). However,
I suspect that the new one is not available unless you have installed \s-1WMP\s0 7].
.SS "What else can it do?"
.IX Subsection "What else can it do?"
You can replay video from .ffm files that was recorded earlier.
However, there are a number of caveats, including the fact that the
ffserver parameters must match the original parameters used to record the
file. If they do not, then ffserver deletes the file before recording into it.
(Now that I write this, it seems broken).
.PP
You can fiddle with many of the codec choices and encoding parameters, and
there are a bunch more parameters that you cannot control. Post a message
to the mailing list if there are some 'must have' parameters. Look in
ffserver.conf for a list of the currently available controls.
.PP
It will automatically generate the \s-1ASX\s0 or \s-1RAM\s0 files that are often used
in browsers. These files are actually redirections to the underlying \s-1ASF\s0
or \s-1RM\s0 file. The reason for this is that the browser often fetches the
entire file before starting up the external viewer. The redirection files
are very small and can be transferred quickly. [The stream itself is
often 'infinite' and thus the browser tries to download it and never
finishes.]
.SS "Tips"
.IX Subsection "Tips"
* When you connect to a live stream, most players (\s-1WMP\s0, \s-1RA\s0, etc) want to
buffer a certain number of seconds of material so that they can display the
signal continuously. However, ffserver (by default) starts sending data
in realtime. This means that there is a pause of a few seconds while the
buffering is being done by the player. The good news is that this can be
cured by adding a '?buffer=5' to the end of the \s-1URL\s0. This means that the
stream should start 5 seconds in the past \*(-- and so the first 5 seconds
of the stream are sent as fast as the network will allow. It will then
slow down to real time. This noticeably improves the startup experience.
.PP
You can also add a 'Preroll 15' statement into the ffserver.conf that will
add the 15 second prebuffering on all requests that do not otherwise
specify a time. In addition, ffserver will skip frames until a key_frame
is found. This further reduces the startup delay by not transferring data
that will be discarded.
.PP
* You may want to adjust the MaxBandwidth in the ffserver.conf to limit
the amount of bandwidth consumed by live streams.
.SS "Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?"
.IX Subsection "Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?"
It turns out that (on my machine at least) the number of frames successfully
grabbed is marginally less than the number that ought to be grabbed. This
means that the timestamp in the encoded data stream gets behind realtime.
This means that if you say 'Preroll 10', then when the stream gets 10
or more seconds behind, there is no Preroll left.
.PP
Fixing this requires a change in the internals of how timestamps are
handled.
.ie n .SS "Does the ""?date="" stuff work."
.el .SS "Does the \f(CW?date=\fP stuff work."
.IX Subsection "Does the ?date= stuff work."
Yes (subject to the limitation outlined above). Also note that whenever you
start ffserver, it deletes the ffm file (if any parameters have changed),
thus wiping out what you had recorded before.
.PP
The format of the \f(CW\*(C`?date=xxxxxx\*(C'\fR is fairly flexible. You should use one
of the following formats (the 'T' is literal):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        * YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SS     (localtime)
\&        * YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SSZ    (UTC)
.Ve
.PP
You can omit the YYYY-MM-DD, and then it refers to the current day. However
note that \fB?date=16:00:00\fR refers to 16:00 on the current day \*(-- this
may be in the future and so is unlikely to be useful.
.PP
You use this by adding the ?date= to the end of the \s-1URL\s0 for the stream.
For example:   \fBhttp://localhost:8080/test.asf?date=2002\-07\-26T23:05:00\fR.
.SS "What is \s-1FFM\s0, \s-1FFM2\s0"
.IX Subsection "What is FFM, FFM2"
\&\s-1FFM\s0 and \s-1FFM2\s0 are formats used by ffserver. They allow storing a wide variety of
video and audio streams and encoding options, and can store a moving time segment
of an infinite movie or a whole movie.
.PP
\&\s-1FFM\s0 is version specific, and there is limited compatibility of \s-1FFM\s0 files
generated by one version of ffmpeg/ffserver and another version of
ffmpeg/ffserver. It may work but it is not guaranteed to work.
.PP
\&\s-1FFM2\s0 is extensible while maintaining compatibility and should work between
differing versions of tools. \s-1FFM2\s0 is the default.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the \s-1SI\s0
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.
.PP
If 'i' is appended to the \s-1SI\s0 unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiplies, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the \s-1SI\s0 unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
\&'\s-1KB\s0', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.
.PP
Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with \*(L"no\*(R". For example using \*(L"\-nofoo\*(R"
will set the boolean option with name \*(L"foo\*(R" to false.
.SS "Stream specifiers"
.IX Subsection "Stream specifiers"
Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.
.PP
A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-codec:a:1 ac3\*(C'\fR contains the
\&\f(CW\*(C`a:1\*(C'\fR stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.
.PP
A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in \f(CW\*(C`\-b:a 128k\*(C'\fR matches all audio
streams.
.PP
An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-codec copy\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-codec: copy\*(C'\fR would copy all the streams without reencoding.
.PP
Possible forms of stream specifiers are:
.IP "\fIstream_index\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index"
Matches the stream with this index. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-threads:1 4\*(C'\fR would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.
.IP "\fIstream_type\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_type[:stream_index]"
\&\fIstream_type\fR is one of following: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle,
\&'d' for data, and 't' for attachments. If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches
stream number \fIstream_index\fR of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.
.IP "\fBp:\fR\fIprogram_id\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "p:program_id[:stream_index]"
If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches the stream with number \fIstream_index\fR
in the program with the id \fIprogram_id\fR. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.
.IP "\fB#\fR\fIstream_id\fR" 4
.IX Item "#stream_id"

.PD
Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
FFmpeg has been compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIoptions\fR must be a list of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR option pairs
separated by ':'. See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual for the list of supported options.
.SS "AVOptions"
.IX Subsection "AVOptions"
These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
\&\fB\-help\fR option. They are separated into two categories:
.IP "\fBgeneric\fR" 4
.IX Item "generic"
These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.
.IP "\fBprivate\fR" 4
.IX Item "private"
These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.
.PP
For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an \s-1MP3\s0 file, use the \fBid3v2_version\fR private option of the \s-1MP3\s0
muxer:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i input.flac \-id3v2_version 3 out.mp3
.Ve
.PP
All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them.
.PP
Note: the \fB\-nooption\fR syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use \fB\-option 0\fR/\fB\-option 1\fR.
.PP
Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.
.SS "Main options"
.IX Subsection "Main options"
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIconfigfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f configfile"
Use \fIconfigfile\fR instead of \fI/etc/ffserver.conf\fR.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Enable no-launch mode. This option disables all the Launch directives
within the various <Stream> sections. Since ffserver will not launch
any ffmpeg instances, you will have to launch them manually.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
Enable debug mode. This option increases log verbosity, directs log
messages to stdout.
